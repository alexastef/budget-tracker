## Installation  
 
    npm i  



## Usage  
To run this app on your own, you should understand what a PWA is and what it requires, how IndexedDB works, and then also be comfortable using JavaScript. Using Chrome Dev Tools is also critical for this project. It enables you to create an offline environment to test your cache and IndexedDb as well as confirm that your app is indeed functioning as a PWA.

Most of the code for this was provided by my UCSD bootcamp, then I wrote the service worker and manifest.
